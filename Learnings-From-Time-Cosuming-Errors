==> For Directive, the selector should have doulbe quotes and brackets i.e. @Directive(
    {
        selector: "[HoverOverDirective]",
    }
    )
    
==> The order of the routes in the configuration matters and this is by design.
The router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes.

==> Most routing applications should add a <base> element to the index.html as the first child in the <head> tag to tell the router
how to compose navigation URLs.
