==> For Directive, the selector should have doulbe quotes and brackets i.e. @Directive(
    {
        selector: "[HoverOverDirective]",
    }
    )
    
==> The order of the routes in the configuration matters and this is by design.
The router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes.
